00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.599
fear not citizens, hope has arrived.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.480
Because I am here.

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:34.800
He's the coolest in the universe. And
once I get my quirk, I get to be a hero

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:39.160
just like him.
Sorry, kid. It's not going to happen.

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:47.120
Even if I'll never have superpowers.
You're worse than the rest of these

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:51.200
rejects, you quirkless wannabe. Do you
really think they let someone like you

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:55.280
in when they could have me? You'd never
be able to hang with the best of the

00:00:52.719 --> 00:01:01.120
best.
Even if everyone thinks I'm useless.

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:05.160
I'm sorry, Isuku.
I wish things were different.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:16.880
Mom, that's not what I needed you to
say. Couldn't you see?

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:21.200
Despite everything, I still dream and I
have to know.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.840
Is it possible to become a hero even if
I don't have a quirk?

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:32.360
I'm a normal kid without any powers.
Could I ever hope to be someone like

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.360
you?

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.360
without a quirk.

00:01:53.439 --> 00:02:02.479
Oh, no. No. No. Damn it. Not here.
People think I don't have a chance. Not

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:08.000
having any powers makes me some kind of
weakling. My classmates like to make fun

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:11.840
of me, but you know what? That makes me
want to prove them wrong. Ever since I

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:16.640
was a kid, I've thought that saving
people is the coolest thing you can do.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:22.319
I want people to see my fearless smile
and feel safe and be the kind of hero

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.560
everyone in the world looks up to, just
like you.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.560
I'm done.

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:13.319
hand.

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:40.680
Make you

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:24.120
Where am I? What happened?
Texas.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.120
Oh, yeah. That bastard.

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:30.479
If it wasn't for him, I'd be out of town
already.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:33.680
That was rough. Weren't you and Midoriya
good friends back when you were kids?

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.560
Yeah, you were a little harsh with him
today. It's his own fault for getting in

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:43.080
my way.
You shouldn't waste your time on the

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.080
guy.

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:50.639
It's just that I've wanted to be a hero
since I was a little kid. I may not have

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:54.000
a quirk, but I can still try my hardest,
can I?

00:04:52.560 --> 00:05:01.199
Someone's got to teach that worthless
nerd how the world really works.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:06.720
I hate it when he talks heroes.
Hey, I got an idea. We should go to the

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:11.919
arcade. Get your mind off it, you know.
Fine. Or we can sneak into the bar at

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:15.520
the station. Pick up some ladies. Now
that's a good idea.

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:20.880
Idiots. If we get caught, there's no way
UA would let me in.

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:26.520
Hey, what's that?
Perfect. I like a skin suit. It's a

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.520
fire.

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:43.039
I wait. Who? What happened? You're
depraded.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:51.759
Where'd all Might go? You You're not
him. You're a fake an impostor.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:55.039
I assure you that I am all
impossible.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:59.360
You know how guys with the pool are
always sucking in and flexing and trying

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:03.240
to look buff? I'm like that.
This can't be real.

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:10.800
I'm dreaming. Oh my's a giant of a man
who saves everyone. He defeats all

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:15.280
obstacles and wins the day with a
fearless smile.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:18.280
There's plenty of fear behind that
smile.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:27.800
I'm counting on you to keep your mouth
shut. Don't go talking about this online

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.800
or telling your friends.

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:36.160
Pretty gross, right? I got this in a big
fight 5 years back. My respiratory

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:40.720
system was basically destroyed. I lost
my whole stomach. All the surgeries have

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:44.319
pretty much worn me out and it can't be
fixed.

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:50.160
Right now, I can only do hero work for
about 3 hours a day. Rest of the time,

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:54.160
this is what I look like.
No way.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:58.639
5 years ago. So, does that mean it was
the fight with Toxic Chainsaw?

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.639
Wow, you know your stuff. But no, the
punk may have landed some hits, but he

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:06.400
couldn't bring me down.
Most of the world has never heard of

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:09.960
this fight. I did everything I could to
keep it under wraps.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:16.880
I'm supposed to be the guy who's always
smiling, right? I'm the symbol of peace.

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:22.000
People everywhere have to think that I'm
never afraid.

00:07:19.599 --> 00:07:25.680
But honestly, I smile to hide the fear
inside.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:30.840
It's just a brave face I put on when the
pressure is high. This job isn't easy.

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:38.080
Pro heroes are always having to risk
their lives. Some villains just can't be

00:07:35.199 --> 00:07:42.680
beaten without powers. So, can you be a
hero? Not without a quirk.

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:49.759
I see.
If you want to help people, there are

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:53.440
plenty other ways to do it. You could
become a police officer. They get crap

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.800
because the heroes capture most of the
villains, but it's a fine profession.

00:08:00.319 --> 00:08:11.319
It's not bad to have a dream, young man.
Just make sure your dreams are

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:11.319
attainable, realistic. Understand?

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:19.560
Now, let's get you to the station.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:37.640
Not good.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:46.399
A villain. I wonder which hero will
show.

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:53.560
Some villains just can't be beaten
without powers. So, can you be a hero?

00:08:49.839 --> 00:08:53.560
Not without a quirk.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.399
It's a monster.

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:32.680
It's taking someone hostage.
How dare you pray on a child?

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.800
What the hell is this? Some kind of goo.

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:46.920
You okay, Death Arms? Heads up.

00:09:47.519 --> 00:09:52.040
Stay back or I'll snap his neck.

00:09:54.640 --> 00:10:01.680
You picked the wrong guy to mess with.
I'm going to take you back to whatever

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:05.320
story you crawled out of.
Let me go.

00:10:09.279 --> 00:10:17.680
You've got so much power. I really hit
the jackpot. With a quirk like yours

00:10:14.959 --> 00:10:21.680
under my control, I can take all my down
with one punch.

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:26.959
Wa. Is that some kind of special move?
This dude is a legit super villain.

00:10:24.079 --> 00:10:32.560
It's her. That new hero lady will stop
him. My only weakness. I At least a

00:10:30.959 --> 00:10:35.959
two-lane road if I'm going to make my
way through here.

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:43.200
Fire and wood don't exactly make a good
combination. I'll let someone else stop

00:10:41.519 --> 00:10:48.000
this guy.
Don't look at me. I've got my hands full

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:52.560
here. Where are those fire trucks? Can
you guys get to him? Can't get a grip on

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:56.959
his weird body. Plus, that kid's quirks
causing explosions left and right. This

00:10:54.800 --> 00:11:00.920
is a shut out. We've got to rally and
knock him out of the park somehow.

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:09.680
incoming.
It's no good. None of us have the right

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:14.240
quirks to stop a villain like this.
We'll do damage control until someone

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:16.160
with the right powers shows up.
There are still plenty of people to

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:19.200
save.
Don't worry. I bet every hero in the

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.279
city is coming.
I'm sorry, kid. You'll just have to hold

00:11:21.279 --> 00:11:28.959
on a little bit longer.
Damn. If I only had more power, I could

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:35.640
blow this guy away.
Uh, this looks bad. Maybe we should run.

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:35.640
Come on, heroes. You've got this.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:47.200
Must have dropped him in the air.
I was distracted, worrying about my time

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:52.800
limit. I can't believe I made such a
rookie mistake. And after lecturing that

00:11:49.279 --> 00:11:56.040
kid about what it takes to be a hero,
I'm pathetic.

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:18.440
He'll never be a hero. Better to find
out now instead of later, I guess.

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:25.240
Make sure your dreams are attainable.

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:33.040
Even All Might said it. A hero needs a
quirk.

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:38.320
Don't cry, damn it. Deep down, you knew
this all along. You've just been

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:43.320
avoiding reality. That's why you were
trying so desperately to prove yourself

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:43.320
wrong.

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:52.800
That's strange. Is the fight from
earlier still going on?

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:58.399
Why am I here? Did I subconsciously walk
this way to check it out?

00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:01.399
I shouldn't even stop. All my notes are
useless.

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:09.240
That's the guy who attacked me. That
can't be right. All my captured him.

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:20.399
But the bottle, if he dropped it,
that means it's my fault.

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:24.560
Why aren't the heroes doing anything?
It looks like they've met their match.

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:29.120
Plus, the villain captured a kid. Things
aren't looking good for him.

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:32.880
He caught someone. I wonder how long
they've been in there. How can they

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:37.800
survive being suffocated like that? I
thought I'd die after only a few seconds

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:37.800
of struggling.

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:43.440
Oh man.
Wait, I'm confused. Isn't that the

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:46.720
villain All Might was chasing earlier
today?

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:49.440
What? All Might? No way. He lost. Where
is he?

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:54.600
Well, can someone call him or something?
Seriously, why hasn't he showed up to

00:13:51.279 --> 00:13:54.600
help the heroes?

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:07.600
I'm the one to blame. He wasted his
energy on me.

00:14:05.199 --> 00:14:11.839
I'm worthless.
He can't power up yet. And none of the

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:17.120
other heroes have the quirks to stop
this monster.

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:23.760
So pathetic.
It's my fault. I'm sorry. So sorry.

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:27.040
Brace.
Help will show up and save the day. I'm

00:14:25.839 --> 00:14:34.440
sure.
I'm not a real hero.

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:34.440
Someone. A real hero will come soon.

00:14:55.279 --> 00:15:01.279
No, you idiot. Stop. You're going to
adventure down.

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:07.440
Not this bread again.
That What am I doing? Why am I running?

00:15:05.519 --> 00:15:12.880
Why can't I stop?
You're too [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:18.160
What do I do? What would a hero do right
now?

00:15:14.399 --> 00:15:21.480
It's 25 right.
Take

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:21.480
this.

00:15:29.279 --> 00:15:36.839
What the hell? Why are you here?
I don't know. My legs, they just started

00:15:33.839 --> 00:15:36.839
moving.

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:43.040
I don't know why I did what I did.
Sorry, kid. It's not going to happen.

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:48.880
You really think they let someone like
you in when they grab me?

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:54.480
Honestly, don't
for

00:15:50.320 --> 00:16:00.759
Maybe it was the look on his face.
Come on. I couldn't just stand there and

00:15:57.279 --> 00:16:00.759
watch you die.

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:11.040
Get the hell off me.
I have to do something. No matter the

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:15.600
cost.
Just a little bit longer, kid. And I

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:21.000
stop playing with you.
Save the boy. This thing will kill him.

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:32.440
I really am pathetic.

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:40.160
Oh my.
I told you the traits that make a great

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:43.880
champion, but I see now I wasn't living
up to my own ideal.

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:55.320
Pros are always risking our lives.
That's the true test of a hero. If you

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:55.320
bet

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:35.840
It's raining.
Don't tell me how all that wind just now

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:40.520
was.
Look at the clouds. They're moving.

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:47.480
Holy crap. He changed the weather.

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:55.440
Did
that really just happen?

00:17:53.760 --> 00:18:02.679
He changed the weather with a single
punch like it was nothing. All might

00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:02.679
save the day again. He's amazing.

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:20.080
After that, the heroes collected all the
scattered mounds of sludge, and the

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:23.240
villain went into police custody where
he belonged.

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:32.960
You [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Do you have a death wish?
There was absolutely no reason for you

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:37.520
to put yourself in danger like that.
I got chewed out by the heroes big time.

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:41.280
While Kachchon was praised for his
bravery.

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:45.600
Man, you're tough, kid. And that quirk
is something else. When you want to go

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:50.520
pro, head over to my agency first. I'd
love for you to be my sidekick while

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:50.520
you're training.

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:12.400
I wanted to apologize to All Might, but
he was sworn by interviewers. I didn't

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:17.320
want to interrupt. I can always try to
send a message through his website when

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.320
I get home.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000
Kachchan,

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:32.400
listen. I would never ask for a weakling
like you to help me. Don't think you

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:35.919
could look down on me. Huh? Got that? I
was fine by myself. You're just a

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:42.240
quirkless failure who won't even cut it
as a reticop. You didn't help me. You

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:48.039
did nothing. Don't forget it. I don't
owe you anything.

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:48.039
What was that?

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:58.400
Kachchan is right though. It's not like
I actually did anything to help today.

00:19:54.799 --> 00:20:04.559
But at least I tried. Guess now I should
get back to giving up on my dreams.

00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:11.160
I am here.
All Might, where'd you come from? How'd

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:11.160
you get rid of all those reporters?

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:19.240
I stand for justice, not sound bites.
Because I I am Mo.

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:30.799
Young man, I came here to thank you and
also to discuss your question from

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:35.600
earlier.
If you hadn't told me about your life,

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:39.760
if you hadn't run into that fight, I
would have been a worthless bystander

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:44.400
watching from the crowd. So, thanks.
Oh, no. It was my fault he was there to

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:49.200
begin with. I got in the way of your
hard work. I wasted your energy and not

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:54.000
to mention your time.
I'm not done. You told me you didn't

00:20:51.600 --> 00:21:00.440
have a power. So when I saw this timid,
quirkless boy try to save a life, it

00:20:56.320 --> 00:21:00.440
inspired me to act, too.

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:10.679
There are stories about every hero. How
they became great.

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:10.679
Most have one thing in common.

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:18.600
Their bodies moved before they had a
chance to think, almost on their own.

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:32.159
For some reason, I remembered my
mother's words in that moment.

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:36.200
I'm sorry, Isuku.
I wish things were different.

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:42.760
And today, that's what happened to you.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:55.320
You never told me, Mom.
back then. The thing I wanted you to

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:55.320
say,

00:21:55.520 --> 00:22:00.039
the words I needed to hear.

00:22:02.559 --> 00:22:08.200
Young man, you too can become a hero.

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:19.280
Dreams can become reality.

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:29.799
Oh, by the way, I forgot to mention that
this is the story of how I became the

00:22:25.919 --> 00:22:29.799
world's greatest hero.

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:45.960
Woo!

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:55.320
You made the

00:22:56.720 --> 00:23:00.919
hide now.

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:18.120
book.

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:41.799
You may

00:23:49.919 --> 00:23:52.919
eat

00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:05.919
Young man, I have deemed you worthy of
inheriting the glorious power of All

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:09.280
Might.
Wait, what do you mean inherit?

00:24:07.919 --> 00:24:15.120
When you're ready, you'll take my
unstoppable quirk one for all.

00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:18.559
So, it's that easy. I can become a hero
just like that.

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:22.960
Of course not, kid. Not with that frail
body of yours.

00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:27.600
Huh? Next time. Roaring muscles.
Midori is going to be super buff by the

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:31.400
time I'm through with him. Go beyond
plus ultra.
